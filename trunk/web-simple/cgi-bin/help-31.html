<h2>Creating your own datafiles</h2>

<p>You can create MRS datafiles by first downloading the
<a href="ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/mrs/mrs.pl">mrs.pl</a> driver
script. This script uses parser plugins to do the actual parsing and
handles all bookkeeping. It assumes you have set up your data directories
in the same way as we did at the CMBI. This means you have some base
directory containing the directories 'raw' and 'mrs'. In the raw directory
there are directories for each databank to be indexed.</p>

<pre><code>
.../data/
     +---  mrs/
     +---  raw/
            +---   embl/
            +---   uniprot/
            +---   pdb/
            ...
</code></pre>

<p>The next thing you need to do is set three environmental variables.
<code>MRS_SCRIPT_DIR</code> should point to the directory containing your
parser scripts. <code>MRS_RAW_DIR</code> should point to the
<code>.../data/raw/</code> directory and <code>MRS_DATA_DIR</code>
should point to the <code>.../data/mrs/</code> directory.</p>

<p>And now you can use mrs.pl to create datafiles. Suppose you want to update
your uniprot, all you have to type is:</p>

<code>./mrs.pl create -d uniprot</code>

<p>This command will start uncompressing and parsing the raw uniprot files
in .../data/raw/uniprot/ and will create a lot of temporary files called
uniprot.cmpXXxxxxxetc in .../data/mrs/. Once parsing and indexing is done
the temp files will be deleted and the old uniprot.cmp file will be replaced
with the new one.</p>

<p>mrs.pl has a number of options. You can see all of them by simply typing
the mrs.pl command without parameters.</p>

<p>A set of parsers is supplied with the mrsweb
tarball and can be found in /usr/local/MrsWeb/parsers/ assuming you installed
the MRS website in /usr/local.</p>
