<h2>Installing MRS locally</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>You need Perl version 5.8 compiled for multi threading.</p>

<h3>Obtaining the software</h3>

<p>To install the MRS website locally you need to first download the
<a href="ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/mrs/mrsweb.tgz">mrsweb.tgz</a>
file containing the website scripts and parser scripts. You then need to
download the MRS Perl plugin. There are currently three versions of this
plugin, one for
<a href="ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/mrs/MRS-linux-i686-1.0.0.tgz">Linux-i686</a>
built for Linux and Intel Pentium 4 or compatible
chips, one for
<a href="ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/mrs/MRS-darwin-1.0.0.tgz">MacOS X 10.3</a>
and one for
<a href="ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/mrs/MRS-linux-x86_64-1.0.0.tgz">Linux x86_64</a>,
a 64 bit Linux version.

<h3>Installing the plugin</h3>

<p>The plugin can be installed by extracting the plugin archive and then
run the usual Perl make commands like this:</p>

<pre><code>
tar xvzf MRS-linux-x86_64-1.0.0.tgz
cd MRS-1.0.0
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
</code></pre>

<p>You will probably have to run these commands as root</p>

<h3>Setting up the website</h3>

<p>Simply extract the mrsweb.tgz file at the location where you want to
put it. Then edit your local apache config file to point to this directory.
Suppose you installed the mrsweb at /usr/local/MrsWeb you would have to add
the following lines to httpd.conf:</p>

<pre><code>
ScriptAlias /mrs/cgi-bin/ /usr/local/MrsWeb/cgi-bin/
Alias /mrs/ /usr/local/MrsWeb/htdocs/
</code></pre>

<p>After editing this file you should run <code>apachectl restart</code>
and then the MRS website should be available at http://localhost/mrs/</p>

<h3>Configuring MRS</h3>

<p>The last thing you need to do to make the website work is define where
to put the MRS datafiles and tell MRS about it. You do so by creating an
<code>mrs.conf</code> file in the cgi-bin directory of MRS. A template
is suplied with the package, copy the <code>mrs.conf.default file</code>
to <code>mrs.conf</code> and open this file with your favorite editor.
Replace the word <code>__DATA_DIR__</code> with the path to where you
want to store the MRS data files.</p>

<p>Another thing you need to do is edit this <code>mrs.conf</code> file
to reflect the files you have locally. Simply remove references to the
datafiles you don't have.</p>
