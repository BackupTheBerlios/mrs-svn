<p>A couple of new features have been implemented in MRS. First of all MRS can now create numerical indices, data
in these indices is still stored as ascii strings but sorting is done in numerical instead of lexical order. To take advantage
of this I've also added the ability to search using an operator like greater or smaller than.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of how this works, consider the following examples:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>To search for all proteins with a chain length less than 100 amino acids:</dt>
	<dd><a href="mrs.cgi?db=sprot%2Btrembl&query=length&lt;100" title="Search Uniprot for proteins with length &lt; 100">
		<code>length&lt;100</code></a></dd>

	<dt>To search for all human proteins with a molecular weight more than 8000:</dt>
	<dd><a href="mrs.cgi?db=sprot%2Btrembl&query=os:human%20mw&gt;8000" title="Search Uniprot for human proteins with mw &gt; 8000">
		<code>os:human mw&gt;8000</code></a></dd>

	<dt>To search for OMIM records released after Feb 1, 2005:</dt>
	<dd><a href="mrs.cgi?db=omim&query=cd_date>=2005-02-01" title="Search OMIM for records published after Feb 1, 2005">
		<code>cd_date>=2005-02-01</code></a> (note the format of the date)</dd>
</dl>

<p>To take advantage of these new features I will reindex most databanks to create
more date and number indices where useful.</p>

<p>Wait! There's more. You can also search for 'strings'. That means, you can do a search for <a href='mrs.cgi?db=omim&query="abnormal auricles"'>"abnormal auricles"</a> and it will return only documents where the word abnormal is followed by the word auricals.</p>
