Manual to MRS.

MRS allows you to search through all available //databases of //.
This guide tells you briefly how to use it.

Searching

Select the database you want to search in the first text box. Enter one or more search terms in the second text box and press Search. 
The search results appear in a numbered list. You should be aware that the number of hits found is an estimate; the smaller the number of hits, the more accurate the estimate will be.
Click on the link of an //ID// to view the entire entry.

Using keywords for search actions

When you enter more than one keyword, MRS will search for entries in which all of these terms occur. You can also enter Boolean searches:
AND, OR, and NOT, which have short-term notation as &, | and ! respectively.
In addition to these /search parameters/ you can use brackets to assign hierarchy to the search terms.
Use ? to replace a character
Use * to replace more than one character.
