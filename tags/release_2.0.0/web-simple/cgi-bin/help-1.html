<h2>Basic searching with MRS</h2>

<p>To do a simple search with MRS you enter a few words in the text box at the top of
the window and press Enter or click the Search button. MRS will then scan through all
indexed databanks and displays an overview of hits.</p>

<p>Searches are done case insensitive. That means that upper and lowercase is ignored,
searches for <code>Lysozyme</code>, <code>lysozyme</code> and <code>LYSOZYME</code>
all yield the same results.</p>

<p>MRS indexes are exact, it does not use stemming. That means that searches for
<code>lysozyme</code> and <code>lysozymes</code> yield different results. However,
MRS does support <a href="mrs.cgi?help=2">wildcards</a>. If you would
have searched for <code>lysozyme*</code> you would have found all records containing
words that <em>begin</em> with lysozyme.</p>

<p>MRS uses an implicit AND for multiple search terms, i.e. the more search terms you
enter the narrower the result set since all terms must appear in a records to generate
a hit. <a href="mrs.cgi?help=4">Boolean operators</a> are also available.</p>

<!--	<p>In this overview you can click on the name of the databanks to see the hits for-->
<!--	that specific databank. You will then see a list with hits.</p>-->

<!--	<p>In this list you can again click the ID of a hit to see the entry.</p>-->
