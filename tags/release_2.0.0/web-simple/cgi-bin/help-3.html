<h2>Databank selection</h2>

<p>By default MRS searches all databanks. However, if you want to search
just one databank you can select it from the popup button at the top of
the window.</p>

<p>The names displayed in this popup menu are the common names used for
the databanks. They do not correspond one-to-one with the list you see
when you press the <a href="mrs.cgi?overview=1">Overview of indexed databanks</a>
link. The reason for this is the overview displays information about MRS data
files on disk while the popup combines some of them into one databank. An
example are embl_release and embl_updates which are combined into EMBL.</p>
